## üéÆ Overview

FogWar is an innovative blockchain-based strategy game that implements the classic "fog of war" mechanic using cutting-edge **Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)** technology. Players command soldiers on a 9√ó9 battlefield where unit positions remain encrypted and hidden until they move into specific zones, creating genuine strategic uncertainty and tactical depth.

## üåü Key Features

### üîê **True Privacy Through FHE**
- **Encrypted Unit Positions**: All soldier coordinates are encrypted using Zama's FHE technology
- **Selective Revelation**: Unit positions become visible only when moving into specific zones
- **No Trusted Third Party**: Privacy is guaranteed by cryptographic protocols, not central authorities

### ‚öîÔ∏è **Strategic Gameplay**
- **9√ó9 Battlefield**: Classic grid-based tactical gameplay
- **Three-Zone System**:
  - **Defender Zone (Y: 1-3)**: Safe haven for defending forces
  - **Neutral Zone (Y: 4-6)**: Contested territory where positions are revealed
  - **Attacker Zone (Y: 7-9)**: Staging area for offensive operations
- **3 Soldiers Per Player**: Balanced force composition requiring tactical coordination

### üéØ **Zone-Based Visibility System**
- **Home Territory Privacy**: Units remain hidden while in their own zone
- **Engagement Revelation**: Positions revealed when entering neutral or enemy zones
- **Dynamic Strategy**: Players must balance stealth, positioning, and tactical advantage

### üåê **Web3 Integration**
- **Wallet Connection**: Seamless integration with MetaMask and other Web3 wallets
- **On-Chain State**: All game state stored securely on Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- **Real-Time Updates**: Live game state synchronization through blockchain events

```bash
# Install smart contract dependencies
npm install

# Install frontend dependencies
cd game && npm install
```

### 3. Environment Configuration
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env

npm run frontend:dev
```

## üéÆ How to Play

### Game Setup
1. **Connect Wallet**: Use the "Connect Wallet" button to link your MetaMask wallet
2. **Create Game**: Click "Create New Game" to start a new match
3. **Join Game**: Other players can join existing games as defender or attacker
4. **Automatic Role Assignment**: The system randomly assigns roles for balance

### Gameplay Mechanics

#### **Unit Movement**
- Select a soldier (index 0-2) by clicking on the board
- Choose movement direction: Up, Down, Left, Right
- Submit encrypted movement commands to the blockchain
- Movements are processed in real-time

#### **Position Decryption**
- Click "Decrypt" to reveal your own unit positions
- Enemy positions remain hidden unless they move into visible zones
- Decryption uses your private key - only you can see your units

#### **Zone Strategy**
- **Defender Strategy**: Control defensive positions, advance carefully into neutral zone
- **Attacker Strategy**: Coordinate assault through neutral zone into enemy territory
- **Zone Control**: Units in neutral/enemy zones become visible to opponents

### Victory Conditions
*Currently focused on movement mechanics - victory conditions to be implemented in future updates*

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Implementation

### Smart Contract Architecture

#### **FogWar.sol Main Contract**
```solidity
contract FogWar is SepoliaConfig {
    struct Soldier {
        euint8 x;  // Encrypted X coordinate
        euint8 y;  // Encrypted Y coordinate
    }

    struct Game {
        address defender;
        address attacker;
        bool started;
        Soldier[3] defenders;
        Soldier[3] attackers;
    }
}
```

#### **Key Functions**
- `createGame()`: Initialize new game instance
- `moveMySoldier()`: Submit encrypted movement commands
- `getMyPositions()`: Retrieve encrypted positions for decryption
- `getDefenderPositions()` / `getAttackerPositions()`: Access opponent positions (when visible)

### Encryption Flow

#### **Client-Side Encryption**
```typescript
// Create encrypted input for movement
const encInput = zamaInstance.createEncryptedInput(CONTRACT_ADDRESS, userAddress);
encInput.add8(direction); // 0=up, 1=down, 2=left, 3=right
const { handles, inputProof } = await encInput.encrypt();
```

#### **Position Decryption**
```typescript
// Generate keypair for decryption
const keypair = zamaInstance.generateKeypair();

// Create EIP712 signature for access authorization
const eip712 = zamaInstance.createEIP712(
  keypair.publicKey,
  contractAddresses,
  startTimeStamp,
  durationDays
);

// Decrypt user-specific data
const result = await zamaInstance.userDecrypt(
  handlePairs,
  keypair.privateKey,
  keypair.publicKey,
  signature,
  contractAddresses,
  userAddress,
  startTimeStamp,
  durationDays
);
```

### Access Control Implementation

#### **Permission Management**
- **Base Permissions**: Contract and owner always have access to encrypted data
- **Conditional Sharing**: Opponent access granted when units move into visible zones
- **Dynamic ACL Updates**: Permissions updated automatically based on game state

```solidity
function _grantBaseACL(Soldier storage s, address owner) internal {
    FHE.allowThis(s.x);     // Contract access
    FHE.allow(s.x, owner);  // Owner access
    FHE.allowThis(s.y);
    FHE.allow(s.y, owner);
}

function _maybeAllowOpponent(Soldier storage s, bool allowOpp, address opponent) internal {
    if (allowOpp) {
        FHE.allow(s.x, opponent);  // Opponent visibility
        FHE.allow(s.y, opponent);
    }
}
```

## üî¨ Problem Solved

### **Traditional Fog of War Limitations**
- **Server-Side State**: Traditional games rely on trusted servers to hide information
- **Potential Cheating**: Server administrators or hackers could access hidden information
- **Centralized Control**: Single point of failure and control

### **FogWar's Innovation**
- **Cryptographic Privacy**: Information hiding guaranteed by mathematics, not trust
- **Decentralized Verification**: All players can verify game state integrity
- **Impossible Cheating**: Even the smart contract cannot see hidden information until cryptographically revealed
- **Transparent Rules**: Game logic is open source and verifiable on-chain

## üéØ Advantages

### **For Players**
- **Guaranteed Privacy**: Your strategies remain truly secret until revealed by game rules
- **No Cheating Possible**: Cryptographic guarantees prevent all forms of information leakage
- **Verifiable Fairness**: All game mechanics are transparent and auditable
- **True Ownership**: Game assets and history permanently stored on blockchain

### **For Developers**
- **Innovative Primitive**: First implementation of FHE-based fog of war mechanics
- **Composable Design**: Smart contracts can be extended and integrated with other protocols
- **Open Source**: Complete codebase available for learning and modification
- **Production Ready**: Built with enterprise-grade tools and security practices

### **For the Ecosystem**
- **FHE Adoption**: Practical demonstration of FHE technology in gaming
- **New Game Genre**: Enables entirely new class of cryptographically-private games
- **Educational Value**: Reference implementation for FHE development
- **Community Building**: Open source foundation for collaborative development
